    <h1 class='subtitle'>Cautious Sexual Attitudes Diminish Intent to Vaccinate Children against HPV in Utah</h1>

    <h3 class='content'>Abstract</h3>
    <p class='content'>Although most Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are mild and are cleared by the immune system, some high-risk HPV strains can cause various cancers.
    Vaccines have been developed that protect against high-risk HPV strains. HPV vaccines have been approved for use by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and are recommended for everyone aged 11-26. 
    Despite the availability of safe and effective vaccines, uptake is low. HPV vaccine uptake has been extensively studied on a national and international level, but less is known about vaccine acceptance on a state or local level.
    The state of Utah, in the United States of America, has a relatively low HPV vaccination rate. In this study, we identified factors that impact the intent of Utah parents to vaccinate their children against HPV.
    A survey was distributed electronically to Utah residents. Survey results were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling, and univariate analysis.
    Knowledge about HPV and positive vaccine attitudes had the greatest positive effect on intent to vaccinate children against HPV.
    Cautious sexual attitudes and high religious practice were found to have a negative impact on intent to vaccinate.
    Effective public health messaging will consider the cultural and religious influences of the target population.</p>
