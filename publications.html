    <h1 class='subtitle'>A Randomized Study to Determine the Effect of a Culturally Focused Video Intervention on Improving HPV Vaccine Intentions in a Christian Population in the United States</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>May 2023</h2>
    <h3 class='content'>Abstract</h3>
    <p class='content'>Safe and effective vaccines have been developed that protect against high-risk strains of HPV, but uptake is relatively low.
    We previously identified factors such as sexual attitudes and HPV knowledge that impact the intent of Christian parents to vaccinate their children against HPV.
    One of the major factors that decreased vaccine utilization was the belief that they did not need to vaccinate their children because of their moral beliefs.
    We hypothesized that culturally specific interventions in the form of short videos would be effective at improving HPV vaccine attitudes.
    We made three short educational videos, one with a Christian focus, one informational about HPV, and one control.
    Videos were distributed electronically with accompanying surveys, and attitudes were measured before and after watching a randomly selected video.
    The religious-focused and educational interventions significantly (P=0.001) improved attitudes about HPV vaccination. 
    The religiously-focused video also significantly diminished the belief that the HPV vaccine is unnecessary because of a family’s values (p=0.023).
    Parents significantly credited both interventions with improving their intent to vaccinate their children against HPV (p<0.001 for both).
    These results suggest that culturally focused educational interventions are effective at influencing vaccine attitudes, even when those attitudes are based on religious or cultural feelings.
    Highly specific interventions are likely to be necessary for optimal improvement in vaccine hesitancy.</p>
    
    <h1 class='subtitle'>Cautious Sexual Attitudes Diminish Intent to Vaccinate Children against HPV in Utah</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>August 2022</h2>
    <h3 class='content'>Abstract</h3>
    <p class='content'>Although most Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are mild and are cleared by the immune system, some high-risk HPV strains can cause various cancers.
    Vaccines have been developed that protect against high-risk HPV strains. HPV vaccines have been approved for use by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and are recommended for everyone aged 11-26. 
    Despite the availability of safe and effective vaccines, uptake is low. HPV vaccine uptake has been extensively studied on a national and international level, but less is known about vaccine acceptance on a state or local level.
    The state of Utah, in the United States of America, has a relatively low HPV vaccination rate. In this study, we identified factors that impact the intent of Utah parents to vaccinate their children against HPV.
    A survey was distributed electronically to Utah residents. Survey results were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling, and univariate analysis.
    Knowledge about HPV and positive vaccine attitudes had the greatest positive effect on intent to vaccinate children against HPV.
    Cautious sexual attitudes and high religious practice were found to have a negative impact on intent to vaccinate.
    Effective public health messaging will consider the cultural and religious influences of the target population.</p>

    <h1 class='subtitle'>Effects of Religious Practice and Teachings about Sexual Behavior on Intent to Vaccinate against Human Papillomavirus</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>Date</h2>
    <h3 class='content'>Abstract</h3>
    <p class='content'>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States.
    Most infections are mild and clear without treatment in 1 to 2 years.
    Some HPV strains result in persistent infection, which can cause various cancers, including cervical, penile, anal, mouth, and throat cancers.
    Vaccines have been developed that provide protection against the highest risk HPV strains. Despite HPV vaccines having been proven to be safe and effective, uptake has been low.
    Religiosity has been negatively correlated with HPV vaccine uptake in some studies. 
    It is hypothesized that religiosity and Christian religious affiliation could impact parents' decision to vaccinate their children against HPV via teachings and beliefs about sexual behaviors.
    A survey was distributed to participants to determine what factors, including religiosity and views about sex, impacted HPV vaccination.
    The survey results (n = 442) were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling, and univariate factor analysis. 
    The association between religious practice and vaccine attitudes were complex, with religious practice slightly positively correlated with pro-vaccine attitudes and vaccine knowledge,
    but also with the belief that religious adherence to expectations surrounding sexual behavior will protect children from HPV infection, as well as more negative views towards vaccines, in general.</p>

    <h1 class='subtitle'>Impact of Local and Demographic Factors on Early COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy among Health Care Workers in New York City Public Hospitals</h1>
    <h2 class='date'>Febuary 2022</h2>
    <h3 class='content'>Abstract</h3>
    <p class='content'>Despite the development of several effective vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread, causing serious illness among the unvaccinated.
    Healthcare professionals are trusted sources of information about vaccination, and therefore understanding the attitudes and beliefs of healthcare professionals regarding the vaccines is of utmost importance.
    We conducted a survey-based study to understand the factors affecting COVID-19 vaccine attitudes among health care professionals in NYC Health and Hospitals, at a time when the vaccine was new, and received 3759 responses.
    Machine learning and chi-square analyses were applied to determine the factors most predictive of vaccine hesitancy. Demographic factors, education, role at the hospital, perceptions of the pandemic itself,
    and location of work and residence were all found to significantly contribute to vaccine attitudes. Location of residence was examined for both borough and neighborhood, and was found to have a significant impact on vaccine receptivity.
    Interestingly, this borough-level data did not correspond to the number or severity of cases in the respective boroughs, indicating that local social or other influences likely have a substantial impact.
    Local and demographic factors should be strongly considered when preparing pro-vaccine messages or campaigns.</p>
